     <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> My name is Emma Emmi Rinat. I am a student in the University of Rhode Island in my second year.<br>
      I am an athlete and I play on the URI Womenâ€™s basketball team. I started playing basketball when I was 10, 
      and my dream was to play basketball in college. <br>
      An interesting thing about me is that I'm from Israel. I live 40 minutes from Jerusalem, which is the capital of Israel.
